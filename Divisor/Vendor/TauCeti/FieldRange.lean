# The degree above the range of a field embedding

An `F`-algebra map `f : K →ₐ[F] L` of fields is injective, so it identifies `K` with the
intermediate field `f.fieldRange`. This file records that the two therefore support the same
degree: `[L : f.fieldRange] = [L : K]`, whenever `L` is a `K`-algebra through `f`.

Both dimensions are needed in practice. A degree over `K` is what an abstract extension
supplies, while a degree over `f.fieldRange` is what any argument comparing two subfields of
`L` — a tower, or a relative degree — must work with, since those subfields are intermediate
fields of one extension rather than separate types.

The `K`-algebra structure on `L` is a hypothesis rather than `f.toRingHom.toAlgebra`, because
the structure the caller already has need only agree with `f`, and for a fixed pair `K`, `L`
different embeddings `f` induce different structures, so none can be registered globally.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AlgHom.finrank_fieldRange`: `[L : f.fieldRange] = [L : K]`.
* `TauCeti.AlgHom.finiteDimensional_of_fieldRange`: finiteness over the range transfers to the
  source — the same identification read for the property rather than the number.
* `TauCeti.AlgHom.finSepDegree_fieldRange` and `TauCeti.AlgHom.finInsepDegree_fieldRange`: the
  same for the separable and inseparable degrees. These are the `f.fieldRange` cases of the
  general transports in `TauCeti.FieldTheory.SeparableDegree`, which is where a caller holding
  some other surjectively-presented intermediate field should look.

/-- **The degree above the range of a field embedding equals the degree above its source.**
Stated for an arbitrary `K`-algebra structure on `L` whose structure map is `f`, rather than for
`f.toRingHom.toAlgebra`, so that it applies to a structure the caller already has. -/
theorem finrank_fieldRange (f : K →ₐ[F] L) [Algebra K L] (h : ∀ z, algebraMap K L z = f z) :
    Module.finrank f.fieldRange L = Module.finrank K L := by
  -- transport along `f.equivFieldRange`, the range restriction of `f`, which is the identity
  -- on `L`; both squares commute because `h` says the structure map is `f`

    hsquare).symm

/-- **Finiteness above the range of a field embedding transfers to its source.** The range
restriction `f.equivFieldRange` is onto, so `f.fieldRange` is finite over `K`, and the tower
`K → f.fieldRange → L` carries finiteness the rest of the way.

The counterpart of `finrank_fieldRange` for the property rather than the number: a caller who
knows only that `L` is finite over the *range* — which is the form an intermediate field usually
arrives in — gets finiteness over `K` itself, and with it the `Algebra.IsAlgebraic` side condition
the separable and inseparable tower laws take. -/
