# Ideals of points of a Weierstrass curve

For a point `(x, y)` on an affine Weierstrass curve `W` over a field, Mathlib's
`CoordinateRing.XYIdeal W x (C y)` is the ideal `⟨X - x, Y - y⟩` of the coordinate ring, and
`CoordinateRing.quotientXYIdealEquiv` identifies the quotient by it with the base field. This file
records the consequences: that ideal is maximal, it is nonzero, and it determines the coordinates
it was built from. Conversely, every ideal whose quotient has rank one over the base field is the
ideal of a point.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.XYIdeal_ne_bot`: `XYIdeal W x y` is nonzero, over
  any nontrivial commutative base.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.XYIdeal_isMaximal`: `XYIdeal W x y` is maximal
  for any `y : F[X]` solving the Weierstrass equation at `x`, matching the generality of
  `XYIdeal` and `quotientXYIdealEquiv` themselves.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.XYIdeal_isMaximal_of_equation`: the point case,
  `XYIdeal W x (C y)` for `(x, y)` on `W`.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.XYIdeal_eq_iff_of_ne_top`: two such ideals are
  equal exactly when `x₁ = x₂` and the two `Y`-polynomials agree at the point,
  `y₁.eval x₁ = y₂.eval x₂`, as soon as the first is proper.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.XYIdeal_eq_iff`: the constant-polynomial point
  case, where the conclusion is equality of the coordinates and properness comes from maximality.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.finrank_quotient_eq_one_iff`: an ideal has a
  rank-one quotient exactly when it is `XYIdeal W x (C y)` for a solution `(x, y)` of the
  Weierstrass equation.

Mathlib has the quotient isomorphism but records nothing about the ideal itself; the many `XYIdeal`
lemmas it does state (`XYIdeal_eq₁`, `XYIdeal_eq₂`, `XYIdeal_mul_XYIdeal`, `XYIdeal_neg_mul`) are
all about products and rewriting, not about the ideal's place in the spectrum. It does record that
the two generators are nonzero (`XClass_ne_zero`, `YClass_ne_zero`), which is what `XYIdeal_ne_bot`
rests on.

Only the curve equation is needed, not nonsingularity: the quotient is the base field either way.

This supports `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 0, whose point–place dictionary
identifies the affine places of `W` with the maximal ideals of its coordinate ring — "the affine
places are the maximal ideals of the coordinate ring". Maximality of `XYIdeal` is the direction
that sends a point to a place, `XYIdeal_eq_iff` says that map is injective, and
`finrank_quotient_eq_one_iff` classifies the ideals with residue degree one.

The roadmap's §"What Mathlib already has (consume)" lists `Affine.CoordinateRing` as consumed
infrastructure that "is load-bearing API here, not an
implementation detail"; this is a complement to that API, not a reimplementation of it.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
that roadmap at `dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`), `HasseWeil/Curves/Basic.lean`, declaration
`maximalIdealAt_isMaximal`. The two `XYIdeal_eq_iff` lemmas are not in the source.

Changes from the source. There the ideal is reached through a `SmoothPlaneCurve` structure wrapping
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine` and a `SmoothPoint` structure bundling the coordinates with their
nonsingularity proof; the surrounding wrappers are not ported, and the statement is made directly
about Mathlib's `XYIdeal`. The hypothesis is correspondingly weakened from nonsingularity to the
curve equation, which is all the quotient isomorphism consumes.

The classification has a counterpart in the same project, in
`projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Foundation/Curves/Valuation/NormValuation.lean` at
`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB @ 1c1c74664e40` (Apache-2.0 per that file's header;
Authors: Chris Birkbeck): `exists_coordinates_of_isMaximal_of_surjective`,
`equation_of_coordinates_of_field` and `exists_smoothPoint_of_isMaximal_of_surjective`, packaged
in `Valuation/SmoothPointPrime.lean` as `smoothPointEquivHeightOneSpectrum`. That statement is
about a *maximal* ideal of the coordinate ring of a `SmoothPlaneCurve`, hypothesises surjectivity
of `algebraMap F (F[C] ⧸ M)`, and assumes ellipticity throughout. The classification below is
written directly against Mathlib's `XYIdeal`: its hypothesis is the residue degree and it uses no
ellipticity or Dedekind assumption.
