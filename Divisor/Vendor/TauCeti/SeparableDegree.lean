# Separable and inseparable degrees under a surjective base change

In a tower `K → E → L` of fields whose lower map `algebraMap K E` is onto, `E` carries no more
information over `K` than `K` itself does, so the degree of `L` is the same whichever of the two
it is measured over. This file records that for the separable and inseparable degrees, alongside
`Module.finrank`, for which Mathlib already has the statement.

The hypothesis is surjectivity rather than bijectivity because a map of fields is automatically
injective; and it is stated for an arbitrary tower rather than for a specific construction, so
that a caller with any surjectively-presented intermediate field can use it.

## Main results

* `Field.finSepDegree_eq_of_surjective`: `[L : E]_s = [L : K]_s`.
* `Field.finInsepDegree_eq_of_surjective`: `[L : E]_i = [L : K]_i`.
