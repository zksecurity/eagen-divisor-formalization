# The function field of a Weierstrass curve has degree two over `R(x)`

Mathlib gives the coordinate ring `R[W]` a power basis `{1, Y}` over `R[X]`, and defines the
function field `R(W)` as its fraction field. It says nothing about `R(W)` as an extension of the
rational function field. The algebra structure for that pair *is* Mathlib's
`FractionRing.liftAlgebra`, but deliberately not an instance — for a general target it collides
with the identity structure on `FractionRing R[X]` itself — so the degree cannot be stated without
introducing it. This file exports it as an instance and proves the degree, in two forms: over an
abstract fraction field `L` of `R[X]` acting through a scalar tower, and over the copy of the
rational function field that sits *inside* `R(W)` as an intermediate field.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.moduleFinite_coordinateRing`: the coordinate ring is a finite
  `R[X]`-module — the companion of Mathlib's `Module.Free` instance, which Mathlib has only as a
  lemma, so instance search cannot reach it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finrank_coordinateRing`: the coordinate ring's `Module.finrank` over
  `R[X]` is two, needing only `[Nontrivial R]` — which discharges the `StrongRankCondition R[X]`
  that `Module.finrank` wants, through `commRing_strongRankCondition`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.algebraFractionRingFunctionField`: the `R(x)`-algebra structure on
  `R(W)`, over any integral domain. Exporting it is enough to bring Mathlib's own
  `FractionRing.liftAlgebra` API to bear on this pair — the tower `R[X] ⊆ R(x) ⊆ R(W)` is then
  found by instance search, and the induced map is
  `FractionRing.algebraMap_liftAlgebra R[X] W.FunctionField`; neither needs restating here.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finrank_functionField`: `[R(W) : L] = 2` for any fraction field `L` of
  `R[X]` — so it serves `RatFunc R` as well as `FractionRing R[X]`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finiteDimensional_functionField`: the extension is finite-dimensional
  over the same arbitrary `L`, which `finrank = 2` does not give by instance search.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ratFuncRange`: the copy of the rational function field `F(x)` inside
  `F(W)`, as an `IntermediateField`. Its API is `ratFuncRange_eq_map`, the defining equation in
  the `⊤.map` form that `IntermediateField.map` lemmas consume, and `mem_ratFuncRange`, the
  membership characterisation; the body is not exposed, so those two lemmas are the interface.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finrank_ratFuncRange`: `[F(W) : F(x)] = 2` for that copy. This is the
  degree above a subfield of `F(W)` rather than above an abstract `L`, which is what any argument
  comparing two subfields of `F(W)` — a tower, or a relative degree — needs; the two are related
  by `TauCeti.AlgHom.finrank_fieldRange`, since the copy and `RatFunc F` are isomorphic as fields
  acting on `F(W)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.relfinrank_map_ratFuncRange_fieldRange`: mapping the pair
  `F(x) ⊆ F(W)` along a function-field embedding preserves its relative degree two.

Exporting the algebra instance is safe here for the reason Mathlib withholds it in general: the
collision is with the identity structure on `FractionRing R[X]`, and `R(W)` is a *quadratic*
extension, so the two can never coincide. The degree itself is Mathlib's
`IsFractionRing.finrank_eq` — `L` and `R(W)` are fraction rings of `R[X]` and `R[W]`, so their
degrees agree — with no algebraicity, finiteness or base-change hypothesis.

## Roadmap

The Hasse strand of `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 3. The degree of the Frobenius
isogeny is computed from the tower `K(W) ⊇ K(x) ⊇ K(x^q)`, where the outer degrees are this `2` and
the inner degree is `q`; the roadmap calls the Frobenius "the key input to Layer 3". It is also
Layer 0 infrastructure: the roadmap's §"What Mathlib already has (consume)" lists
`Affine.FunctionField` as consumed, and this is a complement to that API rather than a
reimplementation of it.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
that roadmap at `dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`), `HasseWeil/FrobeniusIsogeny.lean`: the
declarations `coordinateRing_finite`, `finrank_coordinateRing_eq_two`, its anonymous
`Algebra (FractionRing K[X]) K(W)` instance, and `finrank_functionField_eq_two`.
`finiteDimensional_functionField` is not in the source.

Changes from the source. They are stated there inside a file that also builds the Frobenius
isogeny; here they are separated out, since the degree of `R(W)` over the rational function field
is a fact about the curve and not about any isogeny. The source states everything over a field;
here the coordinate-ring half needs only a nontrivial commutative ring and the function-field half
an integral domain, which is all either argument uses, and the degree is stated over an arbitrary
fraction field of `R[X]` rather than over `FractionRing R[X]` alone.

The source's remaining declarations are **not** ported, each being reachable without them: its
`Module K[X] K[W]`, `IsScalarTower K[X] K(x) K(W)`, `Algebra.IsIntegral K[X] K[W]` and two
`FaithfulSMul` instances are all found by instance search (`algebraMap_poly_injective` is now an
instance in `Affine/Point.lean`, and Mathlib has `FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective`); and its
`isBaseChange_coordToFunc`, with the two private localization instances beneath it, is not needed
at all — Mathlib's `IsFractionRing.finrank_eq` states the degree equality outright, and Mathlib has
deprecated its own base-change-flavoured version in favour of it.

`toAlgHom_ratFuncX` and `relfinrank_map_ratFuncRange_fieldRange` are **not** ported: the first
names the affine coordinate inside the copy of the rational function field, and the second is the
`IntermediateField.relfinrank_map_map` transport of `finrank_ratFuncRange`, which the source has
only in the specialised form `finrank_over_frobenius_image`.
